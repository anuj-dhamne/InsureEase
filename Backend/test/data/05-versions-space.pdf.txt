Telephone call charges and recording
Calls to 0800 numbers from UK landlines and mobiles are free. The costs of calls to 03 prefixed numbers are charged at national call rates 
(charges may vary depending on your network provider) and are usually included in inclusive minute plans from landlines and mobiles.  
For our joint protection telephone calls may be recorded and/or monitored.
What to do if you’re unhappy
If you have a complaint please see above for the contact numbers. Full details of the complaints procedure can be found in the ‘Important 
Information’ document.
If you need to make a claim or have a query about something 
that’s happened please see the contacts on the previous page.
Please always call us if you need urgent help, for example:
●
        your home isn’t secure (eg damaged locks, doors or windows)
●
        there is standing water in your home
●
        a water leak is on-going or water is entering your home
●
        anyone is at risk of injury
●
        your home can’t be lived in
Our personal claims managers offer help and advice around 
the clock 365 days a year. We want your claim to be as stress-
free as possible. If the incident is covered we’ll take care of the 
arrangements. You just have to pay the excess.
Once we have your claim details we’ll put wheels in motion 
and explain what will happen next. Some claims can be settled 
immediately on the first call but if it takes longer we’ll keep you 
informed about progress.
Getting ready to claim
Having the right information to hand when you’re telling us 
about a claim will help us to get things moving quickly. Here’s 
what’s likely to be useful:
    Your Home policy number (unless you’re logged on to 
MyAviva.) 
  Photos of damaged or lost property. For buildings 
damage it is helpful to have close up and distance shots to 
see the damage in detail as well as its location.
        Receipts, quotes or invoices, where appropriate.
  Estimate of the size of the affected area where buildings 
or carpets are damaged. It can also help to tell us the size of 
the affected rooms.
Photos and documents (word, pdf) can be uploaded when you 
tell us about a claim online.
Please remember – in the same way that your car insurance doesn’t pay to repair your car if it rusts, this policy won’t cover wear and tear, 
ageing or (except for optional Home Emergency cover) breakdowns.

BUILDING SECTION EXCLUSIONS
Important Note (If you are the owner and occupier of the home insured by this policy).
Accidents which happen in buildings or on land are, by law, nearly always the responsibility of the occupier (the person who lives in the building or on 
the land) rather than the owner.
If you are both the owner and the occupier of the building, please remember that Your liability to the public does not cover your 
legal liability as the occupier of the home and its land. To protect yourself, you will need to arrange contents insurance which provides 
Occupier’s liability cover.
Under the BUILDINGS SECTION we will not cover:
●
  the excess(es) shown on your schedule (no excess applies 
to Emergency access and Liability to the public).
●
     damage by wet or dry rot arising from any cause, except 
as a direct result of a claim we have already paid, and 
where repair or preventative action was carried out by a 
tradesperson we have approved;
●

this policy booklet.

Important Note
(If you are the owner but not the occupier of the home insured by this policy). Accidents which happen in buildings or on land are, by law, nearly 
always the responsibility of the occupier (the person who lives in the building or on the land) rather than the owner. If you are the owner but not the 
occupier of the building please remember that Occupier’s, personal and employer’s liability does not cover your legal liability as the owner of the 
home and its land. To protect yourself, you will need to arrange buildings insurance which provides Your liability to the public cover.

These conditions apply to the CONTENTS and ACCIDENTAL 
DAMAGE COVER TO CONTENTS IN THE HOME SECTIONS
1. The Sum Insured
  At all times the sum insured must be at least equal to the full 
cost of replacing the property “as new” (except clothing where 
a deduction may be made for wear and tear and loss in value). 
If at the time of a loss the sum insured is too low we will not 
settle claims on an ‘as new’ basis and will reduce any payments 
to reflect wear and tear.
2.    Settling Claims (not applicable to liability claims)
      We can choose to settle your claim by
 
●
    replacing
 
●
    reinstating
 
●
    repairing
 
●
    payment
 
 
Replacement will be on a like for like basis or based on the 
nearest equivalent in the current market.
  If we can repair or replace property but agree to make a cash 
or voucher settlement we will only pay you what it would cost 
us to repair or replace it.
 A deduction for wear and tear will apply for clothing.
What we will pay
The most we will pay for loss or damage arising out of one incident is the 
amount shown on your schedule unless otherwise stated.
We will not reduce the sum insured by the amount under any 
claim, unless the claim relates to the total loss of any item (or 
items) specified on your schedule.
Valuables
We will not pay more than the limits shown on your schedule 
for valuables.
3. Pairs, Sets and Suites
We will not pay for the cost of replacing any undamaged items 
which form part of a pair, set, suite or any other item of a uniform 
nature, design or colour.
4. Items valued over the single item limit
We will not pay more than the single item limit shown on 
your schedule for any one item, set or collection unless listed 
separately on your schedule as a specified item.
We will not pay more than the item sum insured for any 
specified item.
5. No-claim discount
If you make a claim under your policy, we will reduce your 
no-claim discount at the renewal of your policy.
If you do not make a claim under your policy, we will increase 
your no-claim discount until you reach our maximum of 5 years, 
at the renewal date of your policy.
6. Proof of value and ownership
It is your responsibility to prove any loss. We therefore recommend 
that you keep receipts, valuations, photographs, instruction 
booklets and guarantee cards to help with your claim.
If you wish to specify an item valued at more than the single item 
limit shown on your schedule, we will either request proof of value
●
 prior to providing cover for the item;

 at the time of a loss.

Your duties
 As soon as you are aware of an event or cause that is likely to 
lead to a claim under this policy, you must:
a.    tell the police immediately about any property which has been 
lost, stolen or damaged by riot or civil unrest or has been 
maliciously damaged, and get a crime reference number;
b.   contact   
us as soon as reasonably possible and, in the case of 
claims involving damage by riot or civil unrest, not more than 
7 days after becoming aware of the damage, and provide all 
the information and help 
we need to settle your claim;
c.     do  all 
you reasonably can to get back any lost or stolen 
property and tell 
us without unnecessary delay if any property 
is later returned to 
you;
d.   call   
us if you receive any information or communication about 
the event or cause;
e. 
avoid discussing liability with anyone else without 
our 
permission.
Our rights

●
     take legal proceedings for our own benefit in respect of 
the cost of the claim, damages or otherwise; or
 
●
     take over and conduct the defence or settlement of any 
claim.
 
We will have full discretion in the conduct of any legal 
proceedings and in the defence or settlement of any claim
b.
 No property may be abandoned to 
us.
Limit
For any claim or series of claims involving legal liability covered by 
this policy, we will pay:
a. up to the limit shown on your schedule (less any amounts 
already paid by 
us); or
b. any lower amount for which 
we can settle your claim
Once we have made the payment, we will have no further liability 
in connection with your claim, apart from paying costs and 
expenses you incurred before the payment date, or reclaiming any 
costs and expenses incurred by us.
5.   Fraud
 If your claim is in any way dishonest or exaggerated we will not pay 
any benefit under this policy or return any premium to you and we 
may cancel your policy immediately and backdate the cancellation to 
the date of the fraudulent claim. We may also take legal action against 
you.
GENERAL CONDITIONS

6. Other Insurance
 If there is any other insurance covering the same claim, or would 
have covered the claim but for the existence of this policy, we will 
not make any payment under Occupiers, Personal and Employers 
Liability until all cover under that other insurance is exhausted. For 
all other claims we will not pay more than our share of the claim, 
even if the other insurer refuses the claim.
Important note
This condition will not have the effect of leaving you without 
cover for any claim and operates where there is any other 
insurance covering the same claim (or would have in the 
absence of this policy) and determines how those insurance 
policies apply.
7. Monthly payment plan
If you are paying the premium using our monthly credit facility, 
you must make the regular monthly payments as required in 
the credit agreement. If you do not do this we may cancel this 
insurance as set out below.
8. Cancelling this policy
Your rights
You can cancel your policy and/or any additional covers at any 
time by calling Customer Services.

refund of any premium you have paid for the cancelled cover.
b.    If cover has started you will receive a refund as set out in (a), less 
a proportionate deduction for the time we have provided cover.
If the cancellation is outside the cooling off period (14 days 
from the day of purchase or when you receive your policy or 
renewal documents, whichever is the later) we will also charge 
a cancellation fee (see our table of fees shown in the Important 
Information document).
Our rights
We (or any agent we have authorised to do so) may cancel this 
policy and/or any additional covers where there is a valid reason 
for doing so by sending at least 7 days’ written notice to your 
last known address or email address explaining the reasons. Valid 
reasons include, but are not limited to where:
●
  you have not paid your premium (including non-payment 
of an instalment under an Aviva credit facility). If premiums 
or instalments are not paid when due we will write to you 
requesting payment by a specific date. (We will give you at 
least 14 days’ written notice if we intend to cancel due to 
non-payment under an Aviva credit facility.) If we receive payment 
by the date shown in the letter we will take no further action. If 
we do not receive payment by this date we will cancel the policy 
from the cancellation date shown on the letter;
●
  we reasonably suspect fraud;
●
  you fail to co-operate with us or give us information or 
documentation we reasonably require, and this affects our 
ability to process a claim or defend our interests;
●
  you have not taken reasonable care to provide complete 
and accurate answers to the questions we ask (see GENERAL 
CONDITION 1).

the cancellation to the date of the fraud, or the date when you 
provided us with incomplete or inaccurate information, which may 
result in your policy being cancelled from the date you originally took 
it out.
If we cancel the policy and/or any additional covers you will 
receive a refund of any premium you have paid for the cancelled 
cover, less a proportionate deduction for the time we have 
provided cover, unless the reason for cancellation is fraud and/or 
we are legally entitled to keep the premium under the Consumer 
Insurances (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012.
If we cancel the policy we will also charge a cancellation fee.
Important note
The Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) 
Act 2012 sets out situations where failure by a policyholder to 
provide complete and accurate information requested by an 
insurer allows the insurer to cancel the policy, sometimes back 
to its start date and to keep any premiums paid.
9.    Your duty to keep to the conditions of this policy
To be covered by this insurance you must keep to the terms, 
conditions and clauses of this policy. 
10. Index Linking
Your sum(s) insured may be updated monthly (and the new 
amounts notified to you annually with your renewal notice) to 
reflect rising costs in line with the Retail Price Index for contents 
and the House Rebuilding Cost Index for buildings.
We will not reduce your sum insured if the index falls.
11. Joint policyholders
 If there is more than one policyholder named on the policy any of 
them can amend the policy or make a claim and we may pay the 
claim to that person. If you want to remove a policyholder from 
the policy, we can only accept authority from that person, by a 
court order, or by the written agreement of that person’s personal 
representatives (if he or she has died).
